        <p>
            I am Brooke Halinar, a passionate SEO Specialist, Content Writer, bookworm, and musician. I have been in the SEO industry for three years and a content writer for four. 
            I grew up in Pennsylvania, and after moving around through a few states I ended up in the beautiful state of Michigan. I'm currently pursuing an Associate's in English 
            and am planning on pursuing a Bachelor's degree. This is my first project website, and I'm excited to share it with you!

                        each page is optimized for search engine results pages and map packs targeting local search.
